# Project: Portfolio
For week four of the Technigo bootcamp our assignment was to create a portpolio from a given Figma design. We were allowed to change the colors and header image. The site sould be accessible and responsive.

I started developing the portfolio only using HTML. I created all the elements I would need based on the design and then added css. I have used both grid and flexbox to display the content. Some links are not jusr placeholders at the moment but will be live links when I have more projects to show. The same goes for the section about code thoughts as posting thoughts about code is an upcomming part of the bootcamp.

The page have been tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari in mobile, tablet and desktop view. It has been tested with macOS screen reader Voice Over. Furthermore it has been tested for accessability using https://validator.w3.org/, https://wave.webaim.org/ as well as Chrome DevTools Lighthouse with approving scores.

If I had more time I would test the site with more screen readers.
