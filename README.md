# Portfolio

Requirements for this weeks project:
✓ The page should be built with HTML and CSS (JS if needed)

✓ You should use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout

✓ The page should be fully responsive (mobile, tablet and desktop)

✓ The page should look and function the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

✓ The page should work well for people that use screen readers and keyboard navigation.

✓ The HTML code should validate in a validation tool.

I was given a specific design to follow and have done so but using a different color scheme and images. Some links are not live but will be when I have more projects to show and the same goes for the section about code thoughts.
The wep page is buld with HTML and CSS.

The page have been testet on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari in desktop, tablet and desktop view. It has been tested with macOS screen reader Voice Over. Furthermore it has been tested for accessability using https://validator.w3.org/ https://wave.webaim.org/ as well as Chrome DevTools Lighthouse with approving scores.

If I had more time I would test the site with more screen readers.
